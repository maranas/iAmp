iAmp
====
iAmp is a menubar "widget" that lets you control Apple® iTunes® from your menubar.
I have too many MacVim windows open as it is already; I want to control my music
player in at least 2 mouse clicks.

Apple and iTunes are registered trademarks of Apple Inc.

I used the Dark UI template by [Pixeden](http://www.pixeden.com) for the default skin.

TODO:

- Dynamic skinning, so you can create your own.
- Playlist (I put in a photo of fake Japanese food in as a placeholder while
  I work on this :))
- Equalizer controls
